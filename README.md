# Catch-Bomb

* By the time the countdown in the program ends, bombs appear and ask us to catch them.<br>
* Each bomb takes 1 second to reposition.<br>
* Each bomb clicked gives you 1 point.<br>
* Your points are reset after each match.<br>
* The post-competition warning screen will appear and you will be asked if you want to continue.<br>
* If you want to continue, the intent is run again and the backbreak is cleared.<br>
* If you do not want to continue, the user is notified with a toast message that the game is over.<br>
